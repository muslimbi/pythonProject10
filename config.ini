# https://sandiego.craigslist.org/search/apa?query=pacific+beach&sort=date&hasPic=1&max_price=3500&availabilityMode=0&sale_date=all+dates
# would include a search for rentals in Pacific Beach with at least 4 bedrooms, posted with a picture, and charging under $3500 rent
# make sure you sort the page by newest so that sort=date shows up in the URL. The default page count is 120, so as long as there are not
# 120 new posts within SLEEPTIME you should still catch them all. But generally, this means it's better to use many specific searches than one broad search.
